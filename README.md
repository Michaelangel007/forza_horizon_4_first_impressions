Forza Horizon 4 -- First Impressions

# OMG !!!

Normally cover art doesn't do the game justice:

But from the moment you boot up the game, see the cover art, and are introduced to the kick-ass [loading screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYeADDB0Rt8) and music:

Ho Le Fuk!

Forza Horizons 4 is freaking B-E-A-utiful and sounds great!!!

Check out the seamless transistion as the weather changes on the loading screen! Even the wiper blades are in tune with the music. LOL.

# Background

I've always been into racing games with an on-again off-again affair -- due to lack of time with playing a ton of OTHER genres. Here are the racing games I grew up with:

* International Grand Prix on ye old Apple 2
  * ![Grand Prix](pics/international_grand_prix.png)
* AutoBahn
* Need For Speed PS1 -- well I worked on it ;-)
* NFS 2
* NFS Porsche Unleashed
* NFS:Most Wanted
* Test Drive 1
* Test Drive 2
* Daytona USA -- arcade set the GOLD standard of 60 fps for YEARS!
* Test Drive 3 -- I "kracked" this back in the day
* Stunts -- track editor. Enough said!
* Gran Turismo 3 -- a TON of it with my Logitech racing wheel on the PS2)
* Project Gotham Racing -- power slides was never so much fun!
* Gran Turismo Sport -- a LOT of it with my Logitech G29 racing wheel on the PS4

# So what makes FH4 so special?

Now I've never played a Forza game before so Forza Horizon 4 is my first introduction to the world of Forza.

Compared to GTS (Gran Turismo Sport) these are the things I've having an absolute blast with:

* better graphics
* open world to explore
* **dynamic** day-night cycle
* **seasonal weather**
* deep upgrade system akin to GT3
* deep tuning
* better music
* Ability to change the difficulty on the fly
* jumps
* mix of racing, drifting, drag, and dirt racing -- when you get tired/bored of one you can mix it up

# Cut-scenes

The *seamless* transition of cut-scenes to gameplay is amazing. THIS is how you do cut-scenes!!  Sadly, you can't skip them.

I think part of this is due to the high fidelity -- extremely high polygon count and great textures / shaders.


# Graphics

Holy sheep -- look at the **draw distance!**

It looks like they are using dynamic tesselation for the environment.

# Gameplay

# Simulation

Is FH4 a hard-core simulation? No, it is an arcade game.

#   Wheel vs Controller

The game feels GREAT with a controller.

# Music

I'm used to the electronic rock / electro house / jazz [music of GT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_the_Gran_Turismo_series#Gran_Turismo_3) so I wasn't sure what to expect with FH4.

From the moment the loading screen kicks in the FH4's music sounds *good*.  It has the _perfect_ vibe that conveys **FUN**.



# Sounds

Car sounds in FH4 for some reason sound quiet -- almost muffled.  For example the Dodge Viper sounds "wimpy".  I managed to go into a tunnel and got the DEEP roar sound that I was expecting.

It sounds like they are using dynamic environment audio. That's pretty cool!  Just wish the engine sounds sounded "meater".


# Problems

So is FH4 perfect? Ha! No.

* You can't skip the company logo movies.  **sigh**  Do I **really** need to see this shit EVERY FUCKING TIME I boot the game???

* The replay system **sucks:**

  * You can't save a replay -- you can only export the video from the Xbox dashboard. Really???
  * How do I see the telemetry data -- gas? brake? wheel?  This is one thing GTS **nailed**
  * How do I take a screenshot RIGHT as I cross the finish line? You CAN'T because you automatically get kicked out of the replay system.
  * Skip forward/backward wasn't working for me. WTF?

* Restarting a mission reset the radio station. Extremely annoying. As a temporary work-around I turned the radio OFF. 

# GTS vs FH4

How is this a "fair" comparison when they are different genres?

Shouldn't I be comparing GTS to Forza Motosports 7?

It is the **contrast** of the different games that I want to focus on.

First off, both are "arcade" / "simcade" racing games.

Second, the focus of the games are different.  There are no real good "open world" driving games on the PS4. No, the Crew 2 doesn't count. See [The Crew 2 Review: Buy, Sale, Rent, Skip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8u4ihut2Ec) review.
